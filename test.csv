どうも、こんにちは。
まずは自己紹介をさせていただきますね。私はプロのプログラマーで、自由時間ではハッキングを専門にしております。
今回残念なことに、貴方は私の次の被害者となり、貴方のオペレーティングシステムとデバイスに私はハッキングいたしました。

数ヶ月間、貴方を観察してきました。
端的に申し上げますと、貴方がお気に入りのアダルトサイトに訪問している間に、貴方のデバイスが私のウイルスに感染したのです。

このような状況に疎い方もいらっしゃいますので、より細かく現状を説明いたします。
トロイの木馬により、貴方のデバイスへのフルアクセスとコントロールを私は獲得しています。
よって、貴方の画面にあるもの全てを閲覧、アクセスすることができ、カメラやマイクのON/OFFや、他の様々なことを貴方が知らない間に行うことが可能です。

その上、貴方のソーシャルネットワークやデバイス内の連絡先全てにもアクセスを行いました。

なぜ今までウイルス対策ソフトが全く悪質なソフトウェアを検出しなかったんだろうとお考えではないかと思います。

実は、私のスパイウェアは特別なドライバを利用しており、頻繁に署名が書き換えられるため、貴方のウイルス対策ソフトでは捕らえられなかったのです。

画面の左側では貴方がご自分を楽しませている様子、そして右側ではその時に視聴されていたポルノ動画を表示するようなビデオクリップを作成いたしました。
マウスを数回クリックするだけで、あなたの連絡先やソーシャルメディアのお友達全員に転送することができます。
この動画を公開アクセスのオンラインプラットフォームにアップロードしたら貴方は驚くかもしれませんね。

朗報は、まだ抑止することができることです。
ただ 18万円 相当のビットコインを私のBTCウォレットに送金いただくだけで止められます（方法がわからない方は、オンライン検索すれば、段階ごとに方法を説明した記事が沢山見つけられるはずです）。

私のビットコインウォレット（BTC Wallet）: 3JXJLeaYh98s8b9HJnqLucJCr56nPDjgwt

貴方の入金が確認できるとすぐに、卑猥な動画はすぐに削除し今後私から２度と連絡がないことを約束します。
この支払いを完了させるために４８時間（きっちり２日間）の猶予がございます。
このメールを開くと既読通知は自動的に私に送られるため、その時点でタイマーは自動的にカウントを開始します。

送金できない場合はメールにてお問い合わせください。

このメールを誰かに転送しようとしていることが分かると、すぐに貴方の卑猥な動画を公開させます。

合理的に考えて、バカな真似はこれ以上しないでください。わかりやすい説明を段階を踏んでお伝えをしたつもりです。今貴方がすべきことは私の指示に従って、この不快な状況を取り除くことです。

ありがとうございます。幸運を祈ります。",Japan,JP,2021-07-27T03:51:47.000000Z

Lets get directly to the point.
Not one person has paid me to check about you.
You do not know me and you're probably thinking why you are getting this email?

in fact, i actually placed a malware on the adult vids (adult porn) website and you know what, you visited this site to experience fun (you know what i mean).


When you were viewing videos, your browser started out operating as a RDP having a key logger which provided me with accessibility to your display and web cam.


immediately after that, my malware obtained every one of your contacts from your Messenger, FB, as well as email account.

after that i created a double-screen video. 1st part shows the video you were viewing (you have a nice taste omg), and 2nd part displays the recording of your cam, and its you.


Best solution would be to pay me $2667.

We are going to refer to it as a donation. in this situation, i most certainly will without delay remove your video.



My BTC address: 136yr2aYjpAfwqgCAgCKYFZSux4VgAu2Ky
[case SeNSiTiVe, copy & paste it]


You could go on your life like this never happened and you will not ever hear back again from me.
You'll make the payment via Bitcoin (if you do not know this, search 'how to buy bitcoin' in Google).


if you are planning on going to the law, surely, this e-mail can not be traced back to me, because it's hacked too.
I have taken care of my actions. i am not looking to ask you for a lot, i simply want to be paid.


if i do not receive the bitcoin;, i definitely will send out your video recording to all of your contacts including friends and family, co-workers, and so on.
Nevertheless, if i do get paid, i will destroy the recording immediately.

If you need proof, reply with Yeah then i will send out your video recording to your 8 friends.
it's a nonnegotiable offer and thus please don't waste mine time & yours by replying to this message.",Albania,AL,2021-07-27T12:50:53.000000Z

When in doubt, I can do a few mouse clicks and all your videos will be shared with your friends, co-workers, and family.
I have no problem making them available to the public.
I think you really don't want that, given the details of the videos you enjoy watching.
(You know exactly what I mean) is going to cause you a real mess.
Let's organize it like this: you transfer 1500 USD to me (in Bitcoin equivalent to the exchange rate at the time of transfer),
and once the transfer comes i will remove all this dirty stuff right away.
After that we will forget. I also promise to disable and remove all malicious software from your devices.

You can access all your messengers, social networks, emails, chat history and contact lists. Viruses cannot be detected by antivirus software as their signatures (driver-based) are constantly refreshed. So, by now, you've probably noticed why this email hasn't been detected... While we were collecting your information, we found out that it's a scam for an adult website. Your dick lasts a long time and I love going to porn websites and watching fucking porn. Well, I filmed you being sulky and I shot a few videos that show you the process of grabbing and reaching orgasm. If in doubt, you can share any video to your friends, colleagues and relatives with just a few clicks of the mouse. I also have no problems making the video publicly available. I think, given your flair for pornography, you wouldn't really want that to happen. (You know perfectly well what I'm talking about) It's a catastrophe of all time. So let's agree: you send me 2000000 won, and once the transfer is received … 
And so on. It goes on for a while. Same old scam.","United States",US,2021-07-27T16:17:04.000000Z

I am sorry to inform you that your device was compromised.

I'll explain what led to all of this. I have used a Zero Day vulnerability with a special code to infect your device through a website.
This is a complicated software that requires precise skills that I have. It works as a chain with specially crafted and unique code and that’s why this type of an attack can go undetected.

Lets get directly to the point.


Not one person has paid me to check about you.


You do not know me and you're probably thinking why you are getting this email?


in fact, i actually placed a malware on the adult vids (adult porn) website and you know what, you visited this site to experience fun (you know what i mean).


When you were viewing videos, your browser started out operating as a RDP having a key logger which provided me with accessibility to your display and web cam.
immediately after that, my malware obtained every one of your contacts from your Messenger, FB, as well as email account.

after that i created a double-screen video. 1st part shows the video you were viewing (you have a nice taste omg), and 2nd part displays the recording of your cam, and its you.
Best solution would be to pay me $2649.
We are going to refer to it as a donation. in this situation, i most certainly will without delay remove your video.


My BTC address: 184uGAM7dGkVPYoGPvrUtzkL7WE5oHMMWz
[case SeNSiTiVe, copy & paste it]

You could go on your life like this never happened and you will not ever hear back again from me.

You'll make the payment via Bitcoin (if you do not know this, search 'how to buy bitcoin' in Google).
if you are planning on going to the law, surely, this e-mail can not be traced back to me, because it's hacked too.

I have taken care of my actions. i am not looking to ask you for a lot, i simply want to be paid.


if i do not receive the bitcoin;, i definitely will send out your video recording to all of your contacts including friends and family, co-workers, and so on.


Nevertheless, if i do get paid, i will destroy the recording immediately.
If you need proof, reply with Yeah then i will send out your video recording to your 8 friends.
it's a nonnegotiable offer and thus please don't waste mine time & yours by replying to this message.",Argentina,AR,2021-07-27T23:31:03.000000Z

I am sorry to inform you that your device was compromised.

I'll explain what led to all of this. I have used a Zero Day vulnerability with a special code to infect your device through a website.
This is a complicated software that requires precise skills that I have. It works as a chain with specially crafted and unique code and that’s why this type of an attack can go undetected
......
I think you already know what is going to happen next.
During that time, my software was quietly collecting information about your habits, websites that you visit, searches you do, texts you send.
There is more to it, but I have listed a few reasons for you to understand how serious this is.
........
My modest consulting fee is 1650 US Dollars transferred in Bitcoin. Exchange rate at the time of the transfer. You need to send that amount to this wallet: 1nJCE7GPLEgKVtoDB2vNKxivw3U6ogMeS. The fee is non negotiable, to be transferred within 2 business days. We use Bitcoin to protect my identity.
......
Obviously do not try to ask for any help from anybody unless you want your privacy to be violated.","United States",US,2021-07-28T02:45:11.000000Z
